# Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting air quality using machine learning techniques. 
The system performs both **classification** and **regression** tasks on real-world air quality data 
and compares multiple models to identify the best-performing approach.

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze air quality data from multiple locations
- Classify air quality levels into categories (Good, Moderate, Poor, Hazardous)
- Predict pollutant concentration using regression
- Compare multiple machine learning models

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains air quality monitoring data including:
- Pollutant statistics (min, max, average)
- Location details (latitude, longitude, city, state, station)
- Temporal information (date and time)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
